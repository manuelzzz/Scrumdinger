### App info:
- This app was made with [App Dev Tutorials](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training/) from Apple and was super fun to do! (I really recommend you to access it)
- The entire Tutorial used [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/ios/) 16 and [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) 14, but i used the iOS 18 and XCode 16 and adapted the deprecated API's.
- The principal technologies that has been used was: `SwiftUI`, `iOS 18`, `AVFoundation`, `SFSpeechRecognizer`, `FileManager`, `JSON`, `LocalStorage` and the native `SwiftUI State Management`.
